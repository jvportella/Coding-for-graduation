# Coding-for-graduation
C/C++ coding I have developed during my journey on Computer Engineering.

Hallo! I am Victor, 19, and I am graduating in Computer Engineering for Centro Universitário do Estado do Pará - Cesupa, Brazil. Every new code I write comes to this repository. It mainly serves the purpose of tracking my own development; these files are based on activities carried out throughout my degree, involving data structure as well as programming I and programming II, where I learned C/C++ features.
